# ðŸŽµ AI Music Generation Project ðŸŽ¶

## Overview
This project uses deep learning to generate original music in MIDI format for piano, guitar, and drums. The system employs LSTM neural networks trained on MIDI files to learn musical patterns and create new compositions.

## Features
- **Multi-Instrument Support**: Generate music for piano, guitar, or drums
- **MIDI Processing**: Parse and analyze MIDI files to extract musical patterns
- **Neural Network Architecture**: Uses LSTM layers with dropout and batch normalization
- **Custom Training**: Train models on your own MIDI datasets
- **MIDI Generation**: Output generated music as playable MIDI files

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Keras/TensorFlow (LSTM Neural Networks)
- Music21 (MIDI processing)
- PrettyMIDI (MIDI manipulation)
- MIDIUtil (MIDI file creation)
- FluidSynth (MIDI to audio conversion)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-music-generation.git
cd ai-music-generation
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For MIDI playback, you'll also need:
```bash
apt-get install fluidsynth
```

## Usage

### Training the Model
```python
from music_generator import train_music_generator

# Train a piano model
loss_history = train_music_generator(
    music_path="./Music", 
    tool="piano",
    weights_path=None  # or path to existing weights
)
```

### Generating Music
```python
from music_generator import generate_music

# Generate 100 notes of piano music
generate_music(
    num_to_gen=100,
    music_path="./Music",
    file_name="piano_output",
    tool='piano'
)
```

```

## Customization
- Modify `create_neural_network()` to change the model architecture
- Adjust sequence length in `prepare_data_sequences()`
- Change generation parameters in `generate_notes()`

## Sample Output
Check the `examples/` directory for sample MIDI files generated by the system.
